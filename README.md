## Overview

### The challenge

This project is a to-do list application that allows users to:

- Add tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Delete tasks

The tasks are stored in local storage so that the to-do list persists when the page is reloaded.

### Demo

You can view the demo of the project here: [Vue To-Do List Demo](https://saga-k.github.io/Vue-checklist/)

## My process

### Built with

- Vue.js
- HTML
- CSS

### What I learned

In this project, I practiced key Vue concepts including:

- **Managing state within a Vue component:** Storing data (like tasks) in a component’s `data` property, and using Vue’s reactivity system to automatically update the UI when the state changes.
- **Sending data between components:** Passing data from one component to another, via custom events
- **Vue Directives:** Using `v-for`, `v-bind`, and `v-model` to dynamically render lists, bind attributes, and create two-way data bindings between inputs and component state.
- **Handling events:** Using methods to respond to user interactions, such as clicking buttons to add tasks or mark them as completed.
- **Local storage:** Persisting data by saving it to the browser’s local storage so that the tasks remain even after the page is reloaded.
